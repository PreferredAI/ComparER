## How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

There are two variants of ComparER model: subjective and objective. 

### Run ComparER on Subjective Aspect-Level Quality

Run MTER model:
```bash
python mter.py
```

MTER is the base model of ComparER with subjective aspect-level quality. After finish training MTER, we can continue train ComparERSub by the command:
```bash
python comparer_sub.py
```

### Run ComparER on Objective Aspect-Level Quality

Run EFM model:
```bash
python efm.py
```

EFM is the base model of ComparER with objective aspect-level quality. After finish training EFM, we can continue train ComparERObj by the command:
```bash
python comparer_obj.py
```
